## ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT! Read this before you submit a feature request
As of may 2021, I will only create new features as I see fit, without considering any public opinions. Iâ€™ll only consider working on **funded feature requests**. But please be sure to [discuss](https://github.com/davidcetinkaya/embla-carousel/discussions/new) your request first - We need to make sure that your feature request is aligned with the Embla Carousel vision.

Note that this doesn't mean that this library is deprecated. **It's still actively maintained**.
