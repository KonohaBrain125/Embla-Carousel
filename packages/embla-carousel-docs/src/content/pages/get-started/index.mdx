# Get Started

Embla Carousel is a **library agnostic**, **dependency free** and **lightweight** carousel library. It aims to solve the hardest technical challenges with building carousels, and the rest is up to the user utilizing its highly extensible [API](/api/) and [plugins](/plugins/). Embla Carousel works in all modern browsers, but you can easily add **IE 11 support** with the following [polyfill](/get-started/ie11-support).
