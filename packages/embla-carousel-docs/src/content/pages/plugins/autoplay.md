# Autoplay

This plugin is used to extend Embla Carousel with **autoplay** functionality. It comes with a useful set of options that allows you to customize it to your liking.

## Installation

First you need to install the **npm package** and save it to your dependencies:

```shell
npm install embla-carousel-autoplay --save
```

Alternatively, you can use a **CDN** to include it in your project. When using a CDN, make sure that the script tag for this plugin is placed **after** the script tag that loads the Embla Carousel core package, like so:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/embla-carousel/embla-carousel.umd.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/embla-carousel-autoplay/embla-carousel-autoplay.umd.js"></script>
```
