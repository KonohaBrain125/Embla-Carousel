### Code style
All code contributions should follow the current `code style`. Embla Carousel is written with `function factories` that expose an object containing a set of public methods. Note that the public method object should be flat and frozen. Below is an example:

```typescript
// Declare parameter types
type Params = {
    parameter: number
}

// Declare public method types
export type FunctionFactory = {
    publicMethod: () => number
}

// Declare a function factory
export function FunctionFactory(params: Params): FunctionFactory {
    const { parameter } = params
    const privateVariable = 10
    
    function publicMethod() {
        return parameter + privateVariable;
    }
    
    const self: FunctionFactory = {
        publicMethod
    }
    return Object.freeze(self)
}
```
